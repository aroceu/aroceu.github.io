<h1 id="pa">Privacy & Accessibility</h1>

<p>As a big believer in accessibility and privacy, I have done my best to make my websites as accessible and uninterested in visitor information as possible. This includes:</p>


<li>Most of my websites working responsively for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen resolutions; or having alternative options (see <a href="#exceptions">exceptions</a>).
<li>Not using tracking cookies for analytics.</li>
<li>No third-party advertisements, sponsorships, corporate endorsements, or pop-ups.</li>
<li>Using semantic HTML as much as possible for screenreaders.</li>
<li>Night-mode option for higher contrast on select sites that contain large blocks of text and where visitor duration may be longer.</li>
<li>Minimal use of flashing animations and GIFs.</li>


<p>Additionally, my websites:</p>


<li>Use javascript for same-page navigation, galleries, custom fonts, collapsible lists, and occasional smooth scrolling.</li>
<li>Make simple use of iFrames to convey a small amount of information between separated content.</li>
<li>Do not use any audio on webpages, auto-play or otherwise.</li>
<li>Do not make any use of AI-generated text, images, or content.</li>
<li>Allow little to no access for AI scraping, web crawlers, or search engines. I don't mind being shared or archived but I don't want my data to be commodified either.</li>


<p>I regularly link to external websites, and sometimes in a new tab or window. If you click on a link and are unable to see a change in the webpage, be sure to check your browser's tabs or windows to see if the page has opened externally.</p>

<p>Lastly, a good portion of the content on my website is fannish and made for fun and primarily my own enjoyment. Though I recognize that I am responsible for what I put on the internet, I am also a big believer of all visitors having the agency to navigate away from my websites per their own levels of comfort. My websites are accessible, but this does not mean that the content on them is for everyone. Please keep this in mind when perusing.</p>

<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>

<p>Due to the way I like to design, a handful of webpages are knowingly not fully accessible, either because they are currently a work in progress, or because of the selective style of the webpage. This includes:</p>


<li>My music subsection is built with tables so its responsive appeal is limited due to that. However, its content is still readable and contains a notice when viewing on less than optimal screen sizes.</li>
<li>My manifesto page makes use of an animated background for visual effect without disrupting its readability. It is also compatible with reader view as an alternative.</li>
<li>As I am someone with a strong preference for pastel colors on white, some webpages may have color contrast ratios that are not considered fully accessible. However, most of these pages would not require the visitor to read for longer than a minute or so; the sites that would require visitors to read at length (my fic and projects sections) have a night mode option with a higher contrast ratio.</li>
<li>A number of prompt generators with cosmetic quirks may also have inaccessible color contrasts.</li>
<li>Smaller web projects with varying visual effects may contain their own notes regarding accessibility.</li>


<h1 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers & Credits</h1>

<p>I am not making any money off of my websites nor do I ever intend to. It's a hobby, not a job for me.</p>

<p>My websites are hand-coded by me as much as possible. Exceptions to this include websites that run on content management systems, which are usually credited on the specific site. Previous CMSes include <a href="https://picocms.org">Pico</a> for one-page websites and <a href="https://gitlab.com/tfl-php-scripts/enthusiast">Enthusiast</a> for fanlistings/collectives. All designs are made by me, with various sources of inspiration.</p>

<p>I commissioned <a href="https://uwibbit.uwu.ai/">Frog</a> for the chibi art and icons of Pat and Pran from Bad Buddy.  </p>

<p>The notebook CSS background pattern used on kingdra.net, /log, and /me is by Sarah Backhouse from the <a href="https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/#lined-paper">CSS3 Patterns Gallery</a>.</p>

<p>Most stamps, blinkies, pixels, and background images were found by others and compiled uncredited for free use; I claim no artistic ownership of them and only use them decoratively. Pok&eacute;mon trainer sprites are pixel art from <a href="https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/trainers/">Pok&eacute;mon Showdown</a>. Any other graphics with recognizable characters, people, or visual motifs are either official art/photography of the title in question, and/or created or modified by me in some way for a specific aesthetic purpose. </p>



<p>All other graphics are made by me.</p>

<p>Most fonts on my websites are Google fonts, but have alternatives to achieve similar effects if Google fonts are not enabled. The main fonts I use are:</p>

<li>Rochester/Cookie (they look similar so I use them interchangeably depending on which one looks better) (cursive)</li>
<li>Inconsolata (monospace)</li>
<li>Open Sans (sans-serif)</li>
<li>Futura (sans-serif)</li>
<li>Playfair Display (serif)</li>
<li>Georgia (serif)*</li>


<p><small>* not a Google font</small></p>

<p>My prompt generators and other web projects may use other fonts that vary between projects for cosmetic reasons, and are not listed here for my own sanity whenever I make a new one. However, my source code is always freely accessible if you're curious.</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://lysianth.us">Lysianthus</a> for hosting, and <a href="https://cloverso.me">Clover</a>, among others, for being an endless source of inspiration.</p>

		    <li><a href="#dotcom">aroceu.com</a></li>

<h1 id="etymology">Etymology</h1>

<p>"<big>aroceu</big>" is not based in anything specific nor is it drawn from any language. It is a made-up word comprised of letters in a sequence that is significant to me. You may pronounce it however you want; I pronounce it as "ə-rō-su."</p>

<p>My internet name is <b>Arrow Sparrow</b>, named after the Wudai weapon held by Kimiko from Xiaolin Showdown. Xiaolin Showdown is one of my favorite TV shows (not to mention cartoons) and I love Kimiko and birds and long range attacks, much like the in-universe weapon. <i>Arrow</i> is also, incidentally, a homophone of the name I used to go by on the internet.</big>

<h1 id="domains">Domain Overview</h1>

<p>The design for each site represents a level of familiarity, fun, or personal attachment I feel to the page content, while being appropriate for the webpage's intent. I used to redesign my websites all the time when I was younger; but over time as I've learned and developed better skills, my code has become more complex and I'm not as fond of the idea anymore. I prefer seeing how long I can be happy with a design these days.</p>

<p>If you'd like to learn more about each website, click on their link in the list below to take you to further documentation. Check out my <a href="etc#design">design philosophies</a> as well if you're interested in the intention of my design approach.</p>

<p>All of my websites and webpages abide by the idea of being a <a href="https://www.wendycarlos.com/live.html">living page</a> &mdash; that is, they will never be finished, and therefore will always be a work in progress. The only exception to this are my archived projects, which I, for the most part, do not plan on really working on again.</p>

<p>Discrepancies between footer start years largely apply to when the webpage or the contents of the webpage or the sentiments of the content of the webpage (i.e. my writing) were first online.</p>

<p><u><b><a href="#dotcom">aroceu.com</a></b></u> is my primary domain because anything and everything under this URL feels like a reflection of the things I love, or me, which are intimately connected anyway. I'm a passionate creative and enthusiast (and minimalist) at heart, and everything about and under this domain represents that.</p>

<p><u><b><a href="#kingdra">kingdra.net</a></b></u> is for website-related miscellany that are not intrinsic to my identity and instead may be more resourceful or interesting to others. This includes archived projects at various levels of completion but may not receive regular updates.</p> 

<p>The front page is my indie website portal - essentially, centered on my participation on the independent web rather than me. This includes updates, cliques (as they're just fun for me to join), a FAQ (because why not), ideas for the future (maybe), other indie sites I think are cool, and a guestbook.</p>

<p><u><b><a href="#icirrus">icirr.us</a></b></u> is where everything related to my love of Pok&eacute;mon goes. I've loved Pok&eacute;mon longer than I've been aroceu, so this has its own domain.</p>

<p><u><b>aroceu.cloud</b></u> is a vanity URL for my Bluesky account because I love microblogging and aroceu.com is too corporate-looking as a username for me. "cloud" is much cuter and fits in with the conceit of a ~blue sky~. Additionally, with the more technological idea of a cloud, I also use this domain for my email. Any emails sent to my other domains redirect here.</p>

<h1 id="dotcom">aroceu.com</h1>
<p>My main website; and where you go if you want to contact me. It&#39;s set up this way - domain and all - because it&#39;s the URL I give out the most. It has all the information I find necessary about me as well as ways to contact me and links to the creative projects that are close or relevant to me personally. This includes: my fic, library, gifts, and prompt generators.</p>
<p>This site also has linkback buttons, though not a dedicated exit links out page. Friends and affiliates get linked out through kingdra.net.</p>
<p>Sections below are divided by size.</p>

<h2>fic (<a href="https://aroceu.com/fic/documentation">full documentation</a>)</h2>

<li>Where all* of my fic is archived.</li>
<li>Runs on WordPress, uses a good amount of plugins and a custom theme. </li>
<li>Will have commissioned banners  one day, but for now enjoy the star pattern I made in like 5 minutes in Photoshop.</li>
<li>Each fic has its own page and can be sorted, filtered, and searched for in a variety of ways. WIPs have a custom template, fic pages emulate AO3&#39;s readerstyle with personal flourishes, and allow you to bookmark the fic on AO3 (if you&#39;d like), a mirrored link at AO3 (if it exists), and a social media promotional post (if it exists).</li>
<li>Additional features: A mobile menu/filter option, night mode.</li>

<p>Includes: an about section (writer version), related works, my transformative works policy. </p>
<p><small>* Not really, but for the purposes of this documentation the sentiment is there.</small></p>

<h2>library</h2>

<li>Where I keep track of the various forms of entertainment that I enjoy.</li>
<li>Raw coded.</li>
<li>Intentionally reminiscent of cutesy lightweight pixel sites with a modern spin.</li>
<li>Features: collapsible menus, a collapsible gallery, bad color contrast, and an over-abundance of patterned backgrounds.</li>
<li>Inspired by <a href="https://cloverso.me">Clover's</a> <a href="https://catso.neocities.org/library/">library</a>.

<p>Includes: main library, &quot;the list&quot; (to do), favorites, log (current year).</p>
<h2>gifts (<a href="https://aroceu.com/gifts/documentation">full documentation</a>)</h2>

    <li>A repository of the creative and largely fannish works people have made for me over the years. This includes commissions I've paid for (art), gifts from my friends and exchange events (fic and art), and my over-investment in Splatoon commissions specifically.</li>
    <li>Raw coded.</li>
    <li>A cutesy lightweight pixel site, but for real this time.</li>
    <li>Uses Lightbox for image galleries.</li>
    <li>Features: fixed sidebar, lots of decorative pixels, fun and colorful lists.</li>

<h2>prompt generators</h2>

<li>A hub of prompt generators coded from scratch. Free to use by the public for any creative purpose, though the original idea was for fanfiction. </li>
<li>Raw coded.</li>
<li>More lightweight than you&#39;d think; written primarily in PHP.</li>
<li>Each prompt generator has a unique and fun design to represent the fandom/subject it&#39;s generating for.</li>

<p>Notable generators: Haikyuu, MDZS, Sexy Times with Wangxian, any of the lyric generators, to Lovers (a personal favorite)</p>

<h2>splatoon</h2>

    <li>My love for Splatoon in webpage format.</li>
    <li>Raw coded.</li>
    <li>Thematically pink as pink has always been my Splatoon color.</li>
    <li>Image-heavy, primarily in the sense of content.</li>
    <li>The first time I tried to organize all my directories properly while making a project, not afterward.</li>
    <li>Features: fixed side navigation and additional in-page navigation on one page, an outfit gallery by weapon, and all of the Splatoon art from my gifts section plus some which weren't necessarily made with me in mind.</li>
    <li>An experiment in Javascript, for me.</li>

<h2>smaller sections</h2>
<h4>me</h4>
<p>Personal identity miscellany somewhat unique to myself that I don't take very seriously but share for fun. The landing page are my personality test results because I love personality tests. Inner pages include 'pics' (picrews/dollmakers) and 'kins' (fictional characters I feel like I relate to.) Displayed as a flex box, reminiscent of a scrapbook. Inspired by <a href="https://hellomei.dev">Mei</a> and <a href="https://hillhouse.neocities.org">Rosemary's</a> about pages.</p>
<h4>(b)log</h4>
<p>What I'm currently up to online, in fandom, and sometimes in other areas of my life, like the real part of it. Runs on <a href="https://zonelets.net/">Zonelets</a> with a personally customized theme. A combination of small blog posts and <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow</a> updates.</p>

<h4>projects</h4>
<p>Creative works that aren't fanfiction or personal websites. Includes videos, fanmixes, meta/essays, and others.</p>
<h4>music</h4>
<p>A text archive of music I've listened to, in tandem with my respective playlists for each year. I usually nest this one under library for similar archival reasons, even though it is not a subsection of my library.</p>
<!-- <h4>tsn</h4>
<p>A list of quick links of my Social Network brainrot, on the internet.</p> -->
<h4>manifesto</h4>
<p>An essay on the meaning and importance of independent website curation to me. Features art by <a href="https://waneella.tumblr.com/">waneella</a> on Tumblr.</p>
<h4>atlas</h4>
<p>A cross-site map for aroceu.com, kingdra.net, and all other website-related projects.</p>
<h2>archived</h2>
<p>These are older sections that are no longer online.</p>
<h4>stuff</h4>
<p>I decided to remove <b>stuff</b>, which used to host sozai (graphics/web content), in October of 2024 due to redundancy as well as my general preference for sharing my graphics (which I make more of these days than website codes) on my <a href="https://ceu.dreamwidth.org">Dreamwidth</a> instead. When it was up, I used <a href="https://picocms.org">Pico</a> as its content management system.</p>
<h4>love</h4>
<p>My former list of fandoms, removed sometime between 2021 to 2023, I don&#39;t remember. Mostly because I got so tired of the design that I felt happier with it offline.</p>

<h1 id="kingdra">kingdra.net</h1>
<h3><a href="https://kingdra.net/docs/">Documentation</a></h3>

<p>kingdra.net hosts my mini projects, projects that are more resourceful than they are about me, and (archived) one-time projects.</p>
<h2>index</h2>
<p>A network of things pertaining to myself as a website-builder. The top navigation contains links to my main projects, while the bottom navigation contains links to internal pages, including: universal site updates, cliques, ideas, faq, and a guestbook.</p>
<p>The design features heavy image usage, primarily in the form of old school online stamps, buttons, and blinkies. The internal pages change via a central iframe, which also utilizes a <a href="https://projects.verou.me/css3patterns/#lined-paper">notebook CSS pattern</a> for the background. This page contains my latest status from status.cafe.</p>
<p>The background is art by  <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spaceboy">Henrik Dønnestad</a>. The desktop version of this page also features commissioned art by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/azumina.bsky.social">azumina</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lilkikibat.bsky.social">lilkikibat</a>.
<p>I link out to both friends and personal sites that I think are cool from here. This is my primary link-out space.</p>
<h2>links </h2>
<p>An archive of links, like bookmarks, for me to keep track of links I&#39;ve saved over the years (and presently and in the future). Also part of my passion project to the old school internet, which is having a &quot;links&quot; page full of fun and interesting resources, though mine is a bit more expansive than that. Organized by topical category.</p>
<p>Each page is contained in an iframe, so separate pages of links can be opened in a simpler page for independent viewing if needed. The mobile version is only text on a white background, and navigates between the internal pages as separate pages without the iframe.</p>
<p>Features <i>The Sea at Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer</i> (1888) by Vincent Van Gogh.</p>
<h2>archived projects</h2>
<h4>this is our thing (em)</h4>
<p>A webshrine dedicated to the relationship between characters from <em>the Social Network</em>, Mark/Eduardo. I had a lot of ambitions to make this shrine, but I only got through their character bios before my interest in it weaned down. But it was my first attempt at making one, however unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The layout has custom edited banners with circular screenshots from the movie on every page. It is designed largely in black and white to reflect a website that is &quot;plain and simple. No Disneyland, no &#39;Live Nude Girls&#39;...&quot;</p>
<h4>know where to run (kwtr)</h4>
<p>An interactive fanfiction my and my Sports Anime Shipping Olympics (SASO) team made in 2015. I coded the CSS and HTML, and my teammate Icie coded the Javascript. </p>
<p>The website allows you to pick any of 6 different vignettes in any order, with a 7th in the center that is unclickable until all 6 have been clicked. The 7th is the static end, and upon closing out, the visitor gets sent back to the splash page.</p>

<h1 id="icirrus">icirr.us</h1>

<p>See <a href="https://icirr.us/docs">documentation</a>.</p>

<h1 id="fandomring">fandomr.ing</h1>

<p>A webring of personal sites for anyone who considers themselves in fandom. I made this webring after browsing through lists after lists myself and not finding the type of fandom webring I would be interested in. At the same time, I'd been entertaining the idea of making a webring &mdash; and then the obvious occurred to me. So now we have the fandom ring.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

    <li>The <a href="">Onion Ring</a> script to manage the webring</li>
    <li>Stylization that feels both nostalgic and timeless</li>
    <li>Raw-coded</li>
    <li>First main use of wavy underline</li>
    <li>Making good use out of my paid ProtonMail account</li>
    <li>Includes: Code display example (it joined its own ring), an "about" and "ideas" page for beginners, sandpaper background texture, and washi tape looking borders</li>

<h1 id="design">Design Philosophies</h1>

<p>Over the years I've gone by a handful of names and have had quite a few domains. In the same vein, I've had different approaches to coding, webdesigning, and sharing myself online. </p>

<p>Storytelling is my one true love &mdash; and, honestly, the only thing I really take seriously. (I barely even take myself seriously.) I picked up webdesigning for fun and because vanity projects have always been cool to me, but it took a while for me to establish a style pattern that I liked. From making edited banner layouts to simplified pure CSS with 2 colors, as well as my attempts with more elaborate graphic design, for a long time I felt I couldn't settle on an overall aesthetic that I liked <i>and</i> could pull off as well as I wanted to. Though I was interested in drawing when I was younger, as I put more of my energies into polishing up my storytelling abilities, visual art fell by the wayside for me &mdash; it had become something that I would rather be an enthusiastic enjoyer of rather than a creator for.</p>

<p>I'm an organized and logical thinker. I love exploring technicalities and creating within boundaries, and so even though my interest in drawing and graphic design weaned away, my passion for website building continued to grow. Still, design is a huge element of web development, and while webdesign styles aren't necessarily categorical, I've always known that eventually, I'd want to establish a stylistic identity that would make me stand out. That's one of the beauties of independent web design, isn't it? Instead of building websites for monetary profit, I focus more on what represents me and what <i>I</i> like.</p>

<p>But then that meant that I had to figure out who I was, what I liked, and how I could incorporate my neuroses as well.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Graphic & Organizational Design</h2>

<p>Though I tried in my early days to get into graphic design, it's certainly not in my stylistic instinct. I have better instincts (and software) now, but for a long time now it hasn't been a fundamental part of my webdesign process, only as a decorative additive.</p>

<p>I start here when talking about how I build websites, because it's how I started. But my primary approach now centers text content and convenience, neither of which images are really a necessity for. I learned this from my own experiences with myself; a lot of my early designs were very graphic design-dependent, and though I'm sure my skill now would be a vast improvement from then, I also know that mentally, it feels rigid in existence for me. What if I want to change something, or need to add something, or decide I want to move certain things around, or realize that the way something in an image would look better in a different position/font/color ages after I published it? Sure, I can always edit it &mdash; but the point is that I'm an incredibly indecisive person who has little propensity or patience for being satisfied with my own visual art, and also wants things to last for a long time. The way I feel about custom graphics on my own website is often not compatible with that, even if the time to edit an image takes the same amount of time to edit code.</p>

<p>Between all the aspects of web design and development, I would say that CSS is my favorite part. It's a combination of logic and stylization, modular building and front-end flexibility. And when I don't have images as part of a website's design, CSS is what makes those designs unique and stylized anyway, even without more elaborate flourishes. I'm a minimalist at heart, mostly because I get overwhelmed easily. So the dependency on CSS over graphics in most of my websites represents that. And it's a lot more convenient for me to adjust if I change my mind about something.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm drawn to making designs that best present and represent the content they're displaying in some way, with both personal and modern flourishes. Websites are about the content, after all; the design is the architecture. Much like storytelling, I take a lot of care into thinking about the most effective (simplistic & convenient) way of presenting the content, while in the same vein figuring out how to make it unique and distinct &mdash; how the site could represent choices only <i>I</i> would make for its design. I suppose this is redundant since only I can make the things that I make...but my point stands. Even if the decision is as simple as <code>&lt;text in white box on a colored background in the middle of the page&gt;</code> I made the decision for a reason in the first place.</p>

<p>I also now enjoy using graphics made by others a lot more than I used to. When I was younger, I was much more possessive and selective about having only graphics that I made, as part of a personal neurosis for being entirely self-made. But since then I've relaxed, especially when it comes to building webpages that <i>aren't</i> just about the things that I've made. Creativity is not an antonym of transformative, and it brings me a lot of joy to be inspired by others and use the resources available to me to build something that's not only representative of me, but also how I see and interact with the world.</p>

<p>But I won't get too philosophical, because sometimes it's not that deep. Sometimes it's because I like lighter and less saturated shades of blue; because I like anchors as an image motif; because the easiest way to experience content is by having it be easy to experience in the first place. Though my code and personal practicing skill may have a few areas of improvement, what matters most to me is having a website and going, look, that's mine, isn't it neat? And at this point in time, I'd like to think I'm pretty good at that.</p>

<p>Obviously this is not to say anything against other approaches to design: this is simply mine. I love admiring websites that were designed by people who think much differently than me (everyone), because I think "man I wish I could do something like that" and get reminded of the prison maze of my mind. But you ought to see my Animal Crossing: New Horizons island &mdash; it's like a prison maze if it was for cute animals.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Fonts</h2>

<p>I've put a lot of thought into font usage all my life, both as a writer and as a designer. Even now, though I've settled into a vibe that feels accessible and convenient and unique (all of which are my primary concerns with anything visually creative on my end), fonts are still something I spend a lot of time thinking deeply about, because much like any other aspect of design, they are fundamental in not only displaying <i>what</i> the content is, but <i>how</i> it gets displayed and read.</p>

<p>I prefer serif (Cambria) when writing stories, but sans-serif when it's my website telling the story, not me. I like to think it's because I take writing more seriously than websiting; sans-serif has always felt more informal and everyday to me, much like my own approach to websites. Yet there's no denying my passion for it even in this regard, so I've really become inclined to monospace fonts as well. Maybe these things are connected. Most of the pages on this personal domain use the same monospace font, so maybe that means something.</p>

<p>Either way, like my preference for designs being long-lasting, I like having dependable fonts as well, rather than needing to scour the many font websites and repositories to find a new one that I like. Most of my website projects are vanity projects anyway, so that checks out. I would say though that my favorite font style is undoubtedly a handwritten cursive, because it emulates the casual cutesy but stylized vibe that I usually go for. And that's how I would describe my actual handwriting too.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Colors</h2>

<p>Establishing an identity of colors in design was as difficult and long as my own indecision when it comes to colors I like. Now I'm confident when I say that my favorite color is a light less-saturated blue.</p>

<p>Still, like with the people in the world (and on the internet), I have a relationship with colors, too. Pink was the very first color I fell in love with, but I've always been personally drawn to lighter, tealer shades of blue &mdash; never really the royal side though. I feel a kinship with the ocean too, and if I had to describe my personality and understanding of myself as a color, it would also be that light shade of grey-blue.</p>

<p>I say this here because all of my websites on my .com are very notably centered around this blue (or variants), if you haven't noticed. Blue feels like it's <i>me</i>; pink feels like the things I love, and I love a lot of things as well. Even the theming around things I love, people I love, and my favorites of things tend to skew more pink, with the exception of my <a href="https://icirr.us/trainer/favs">Pok&eacute;mon favorites</a>, because I wanted to put my favorite NPC (Clair) as the trainer avatar, and the rest of the page complementary to her. </p>

<p>I used to be less personally deliberate with my colors. Actually, my original color palette for a long time and that I often fall back to &mdash; even today &mdash; is black and white. Can't go wrong with the classics, you know. <small>And I used to be obsessed with yin yang symbolism, but that's beside the point.</small> But how I feel about colors when making websites is also like how I feel about the colors in my wardrobe (there's a lot of black) &mdash; I like the idea of being colorful and more experimental and fun, but most times I'll prefer what I'm used to liking and saying are my favorites. </p>

<p>The second time I bought a domain (but the first time it felt personal to me), I had the idea to have all the different subsections of my website centered around a different hue of the rainbow. My blog would be bright pink-red, my contact form would be blue, my fanlistings collective would be green, my portfolio would be yellow, and my web content site would be purple. Though this was certainly a fun idea, it felt like I was dividing myself up into pieces by making them so distinctly different. Now I have even more subsections of my website than I did back then &mdash; but having the blue centering them all feels like they tie back together to represent a whole version of me.</p>

<p>All's this to say: I "am" blue (obviously not really, but I just typed all of this, so...), I love pink, I have a lot of black clothing, and I think other colors are cool and I would use them for designs that are not deeply personal to me. If I had to pick a color I don't like, it would be green because I would always choose it last when selecting colors for any designing purpose, but I don't actively dislike it. I even love grass starters in Pok&eacute;mon.</p>

<h1 id="development">Development</h1>
<p>I am not a very disciplined developer; everything I learned about web development I initially learned through trial and error with constant browser refreshes, and using whatever's the most convenient to me at the time, so that's the habit I've maintained for the past couple of decades. I recognize that this is not best practice and I am, little by little, trying to improve that.</p>

<p>From beginning to end, here's how I go through the process of creating a website:</p>

<p>First, I come up its concept &mdash; not only what it contains or what its purpose is, but its functionality as a website on the internet, or at least within my existing websites. Several questions I like to consider are:</p>
        <li>Is it going to be a smaller section contained in another, or a large section with its own subpages, or an offshoot section? This is generally determined based on where I would anticipate linking it from and to.</li> 
            <li>Is it static or dynamic? How frequently will I need to update it? How can I maintain updates in the most convenient way possible for me?</li>
            <li>How does the navigation work? Will it have links to all the internal pages, or select links for logistical reasons?</li>
            <li>Will it have any subpages? Would it be easier to maintain if it had subpages?</li>
            
<p>Next is the design. This mostly starts in my head, but almost always I like to draw it out as a wireframe to get a concrete picture and leave specific notes, such as ideas for colors, fonts, interactions, and other elements. From experience, I know that not drawing my design leads me to be extremely indecisive during the coding process. I don't have a preference on my method of drawing &mdash; whether in a notebook or on a piece of cardboard (I have done this before) &mdash; but drawing a website as well as connecting its interactions with other pages has always been a part of my process.</p>

<p>It's important to me that my designs are: simple, intuitively navigable, reflect an aspect of myself or an aspect of the content that I want to display on the webpage, and have a unique or fun element that may make it stand out in one's memory. I'm especially drawn to colors and elemental organization when it comes to design. Some things I keep in mind are:

    <li>Font usage. Fonts represent a tone or character, so it's important to think about the text's intention. For general body text, I favor both sans-serif (due to both its screen preference and more casual connotation) and monospace. I often reserve serif for flavor text.</li>
    
    <li>Padding and containment. Containment is primarily for coding purposes. But I'm also a big fan of negative space.</li>
    <li>Images. What would their purpose be? How much might they distract from the text, or would they make the text more interesting? Would they be necessary, decorative, or excessive? I tend to make more lightweight minimalistic designs, so I don't like depending on graphics.</li>
    <li>Navigation. This includes, but is not limited to: between internal pages, how I would link to the page from any of my existing websites, and the parent-child relationships between internal sections.</li>
    </p>

<p>Then I get to coding, starting with a local file and building from there. As of March 2025 I've incorporated XAMPP into my workflow, which now hosts all of my websites and projects locally, with the exception of WordPress projects in terms of databases, but is still used to test WordPress themes. I create and make all modifications and test locally in XAMPP, typically in raw HTML, CSS, and PHP, with VS Code to help me keep track of every file within a project. (I also anticipate trying out 11ty sometime soon...we'll see!)</p> 

<p>Writing CSS is the most fun part for me, but that's why I start by working on the HTML first - in order to design something, it has to exist in the first place. I code modularly and (sometimes) leave comments in my code, though I've always been a "figure it out" kind of guy, even to myself. In terms of HTML content, I'm a pendant when it comes to word choice, phrasing, and the anatomy of sentences and paragraphs even in an indulgent way. But I'm a lot less concerned in the beginning; copyediting is for the end. I frequently decide to add more HTML elements while writing CSS, so it often tends to be a dual process.</p> 

<p>I like gathering images all at once, instead of figuring them out and adding them bit by bit. This usually constitutes me hand-drawing out a layout first, so I know exactly what kind of graphics I'll need for what, and then dedicating a block of time during the process to hunt them all down before chaining myself to my text editor for the next few hours.</p>

<p>It's difficult for me to work on a site without refreshing the page each time I change or add something to make sure it looks nice. But I suppose this isn't as bad practice as I used to think it was, I just do it locally now. It helps me as well because usually there's always something I'm forgetting in the beginning of creating any project that I can only remember later when I've stared at the webpage long enough to realize what was missing. Through XAMPP I test all the interactive elements to make sure everything works at all times; after I upload the site, I do this again, to account for relative links working. A lot of times while troubleshooting I get better or newer ideas, so it's not unusual for me to make a slightly more significant change even at further points in development.</p>

<p>Toward the end of working on project before making it go live, when I'm satisfied with what I've done for the bulk of its content and design, I start copyediting, rewriting, and rewording some things. I frequently have my phone or computer speak out loud longer blocks of text so I can hear how they sound and make sure that they feel coherent and not too redundant. I am a perfectionist with writing, after all. I also do alt text writing in this stage if I remember to. In my defense, remembering to write alt text is as difficult for me to remember as it was when I was 12.</p>

<p>When I feel that a site is ready to go live, or that I've made all the changes that I want to make in the sitting, I copy the files from XAMPP to my local directory, which I use to organize Git projects. I also do this because the XAMPP directories have folders of unfinished or barely started projects for me to keep track of future plans, while my local directory is for me to keep track of my current ones.</p>

<p>Depending on the project, from the local directory I either upload the changes with FTP via Forklift, or push the changes through Github Desktop and pull them from GitVersion Control in cPanel. I try not to make more changes after this, as using XAMPP has cut that bad practice of mine, I guess. But no promises.</p>

<p>I save the responsive design for last because I don't find it particularly interesting or fun; it's my least favorite part of web development. But I understand its necessity, especially in terms of accessibility, so I configure it at the end. I have a habit of not incorporating responsive designs when I initially make a website go live and instead just configure it later when I feel like it. This is a "<a href="https://i.imgur.com/OgBfYg8.jpeg">I am a dumb bitch with terrible taste / I will never change / I will never improve / That is a promise</a>" moment for me. </p>

<p>I do believe that much like fashion, a website's development is never over. I'm always interested in ways to improve my websites, or make more of them. And I love visiting my own websites - it's fun, and as time passes it gives me a new perspective on how I want to change, or what I might want to add. So, eventually, the workflow stays in the troubleshooting stasis period forever, or starts all over again. </p>

<h1 id="purpose">Personal Site Purpose</h1>

<p>I don't aim for my websites to be perfect, because I don't aim for myself to be perfect. My main motivator in making websites throughout my entire journey has been prioritizing my inner wants and reflecting them as they are true to me. This has resulted in my messy, inconsistent, not always accessible, and often questionably fluent practices whilst making websites. But that's a part of my website and design work ethic, and though I like to improve, the only standards I hold myself to are my own based on what my goal is, which more often than not is to make a fun and creative website, first and foremost.</p>

<p>My favorite websites to visit have always been ones that felt like a scavenger hunt, an experience that required me to explore. So in the same way, I've put a lot of effort into making all of my websites like this. Creatively and from a webdesign angle, I'm most interested in making the type of things I <em>want</em> to see, which also includes the things that I want to experience. It's just as important for me to be in the audience as it is for me to be the word of god; it's a conversation, even if I'm on both sides of it. And yet I think it's an accurate way to depict both myself, and how I see the world. I believe in rewarding curiosity, and that curiosity - the willingness to explore - certainly deserves results. I try to deliver it from my end because I know how much I love it when I'm on the receiving end, and I want to see if other people might be curious in the way that I am too.</p>

<p>Personal authenticity and the agency of choice are the things that drive me the most in my life. While many other things are important to me for many other reasons, at the end of the day, feeling true to who I am and knowing what I want to do - who I want to be - rule my decision making process when it comes to things that are important to who I am. It allows me to recognize and accept myself, flaws and all, and take pride in my uniqueness and inner world, things no one can change because if they could, I wouldn't be myself. I treat and design and care for my websites similarly: if I feel like working on them for something, I will, and if I don't, I won't. If I want to structure a site or a page in a way that makes sense to me even if it may make much less sense to most others, then I will.</p>

<p>I don't aim to be inaccessible, of course. But I also don't aim to allow others' expectations and standards of me to guide my choices or behavior; I'm simply not built like that. I love dialogue and feedback and learning new perspectives because I like learning about the different ways people navigate and communicate and exist in the world; at the same time, I'm on an endless journey to understand myself as well. My conversations and relationships with others do influence me and I'm sure I also influence them, but at the same time I will never hold anyone else's evaluation of me over my own evaluation of myself. And I hope most others are the same way about me - what I think of you matters much less than what <em>you</em> think of you. And what I think of myself and my websites matters much more to me than what others do, too.</p>

<p>I have very strong feelings about nominal, visual, and substance identity. My sites are alive in my head, a dynamic extension of myself in a static interactive visual experience for others. I aim to make the life I breathe into each site and design feel like an active part of the visitor experience, even if incoherent; I aim to do everything with meaning, like fonts and punctuations and minutiae and positioning and sizing and colors and every other element of style. I love the diversity of a collation of designs, and I love it even more when they still insist or try to be part of the uniform identity of this site, <em>me</em>. I love expressing all these different parts of myself. I like thinking about what I want a site or a page to be and how every single element contributes to that in its function, in its identity, in the impression it leaves the visitor. I like creating a cohesive narrative out of a series of small but certainly consequential stylistic and characteristic decisions, because that's also what a narrative is.</p>

<p>I have always felt like an endless depth of tastes and interests and desires and experiences and curiosities; it's one of the reasons why I love exploring the deep sea of the web as well. There's as much of the world out there as there is in me. So I let out all the universes inside of me through the things I make, my websites and designs and pages, even if everything inside of me turns out to be maybe a few hundred pages or so. Still, I'm always trying to relate to everyone that I encounter because I feel the capacity inside of me, that I want to, that I can. In the same way I'm terribly curious about everything, reaching for new perspectives and experiences, wanting to find something new, too, in an ocean of boundless depth and mystery, even in myself. I think my authenticity brings more enrichment even if it may not be accessible at times, because for me being an inconvenience is preferable to being dull and conforming. </p>

<p>I can only make websites that I want to make. That's why I brute-force taught myself this and got into website-making in the first place. It was about the uniqueness of all the small little design elements, the fluidity, the control, the agency. It's a show of my id through my ego, my science through my art, and most importantly, me through something I have always adored and been fascinated by as long as I can remember - technology, and the internet. It's a conversation between me and myself, future and past iterations. </p>

<p>And, of course, it's a conversation between me and you. I believe that the reason we're here for anything is because of our relationships with everyone else in the world, whether in a voyeuristic way or in dialogue. Our relationships with each other enrich our lives, both because learning about others helps us learn about ourselves, and because they just do, even if we're only ships passing in the night. </p>

<h1 id="origins">Origins</h1>

<p><i>This is a technical overview of my journey with website-making. You can also read <a href="https://aroceu.github.io/thoughts/25/webdesign-history">a narrative of my webdesign beginnings</a>, told through the lens of persuading others to make their own personal websites.</i></p>

<p>In 2007 I learned the foundations of what it means to code on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">MySpace</a>, and eventually learned more little by little through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMVU">IMVU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quizilla">Quizilla</a> in the same year. MySpace and IMVU had similar types of code tweaking in adding nested and floating elements, changing colors of things, making little flourishes but essentially moving elements around on a pre-existing page. Quizilla showed me the fluidity of webdesign &mdash; and what it meant to truly customize a webpage for yourself.</p>

<p>I learn best by doing, so that's what I did. I took other people's code and tried to adjust it to my own liking, but didn't know what I was doing. Like playing a video game for the first time but not reading any of the text. Eventually, though, after much trial and error (and maybe glancing over one or two tutorials when I was getting desperate) I understood the basics of code. Through Quizilla I had also found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freewebs">Freewebs</a>, which eventually got named to Webs and was the Neocities of its day. Because I had found these sites through the footers of those who were using custom layouts, this was the first type of personal website I got introduced to: those that made layouts for others.</p>

<p>And so through fiddling with my own layout code, that's what I tried to do &mdash; I made layouts for others too. Not necessarily because I expected people to use them, but because once I started making a website design, I couldn't stop. I wanted to keep doing it. It was addicting.</p>

<p>So even with my limited knowledge of code, I started a FreeWebs site in early 2008, my first one. She was a legend, with screenshot graphics of a Disney movie "edited" in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSPaint">Paint</a>. Like the websites I had seen before, I offered <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sozai">sozai</a> &mdash; web content, graphics and layouts. I also enjoyed looking at others' websites; I began to love going down a clickhole of personally designed websites, that I regularly asked website owners if they wanted to affiliate. After a rejection that remarked upon the quality of my graphics, but was not discouraging, I acknowledged that yes, I needed a better photo editor.</p>

<p>I downloaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif_PhotoPlus">PhotoPlus</a>. It wasn't Photoshop, but it wasn't Paint. Though my initial attempts at graphics were rough, I did eventually get better - to the point of effectiveness, at least, because there are graphic designers I will always envy. But with an eventual confidence in my competent level of graphic design, I decided to move "up" in the webdesign hierarchy in my head &mdash; from a Quizilla site, to a FreeWebs site, and then a subdomain. I wanted a domain eventually, but would definitely need the time to invest and improve first.</p>

<p>The subdomain I procured in early 2009 felt like a true attempt at sophistication. It was also the first time I tried (and succeeded) at writing the code from scratch on my own. I had branched beyond the sozai artists, and stumbled across bloggers &mdash; they offered content as well, but also wrote extensively about their lives. It seemed interesting to me, someone who loves to write and spin narratives out of everything. In this time I also learned PHP, and started learning what code <i>meant</i> not just what it does. A short few months later, for my birthday I asked my mom for a domain as a gift, and I got it. The domain was on a whim and wasn't something I felt personally connected to, but it was a fulfilling purchase nonetheless, and motivated me to continue to do this, and to be better, for <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>My growing attempts to understand how to both design and code well continued on, up until a k-pop hyperfixation overtook my life at the end of 2009.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I returned to the hobby a couple of years later in 2011. After a much needed break and with a new pair of eyes, my perspective was fresh and cleaner. The addiction was still there, but noticing the improvement in my quality truly made me feel like I could become skilled at this. My budding return to the desire of improving eventually had me returning to the subdomain world about a year later, with my first attempt at a WordPress theme. I wanted to get into blogging; committing to making content wasn't reliable if I wasn't hyperfixated. I should've known that blogging wasn't much different either. But fiddling with the WordPress theme had fascinated me, and I began getting interested in creating those too.</p>

<p>A semi-successful couple of years of blogging later, I purchased a domain again in 2012, but still with the purpose of blogging. That period of my life was particularly difficult and my blog posts reflected that; but despite that, the WordPress themes I made under that domain, both for my website and otherwise, were excellent and I like to show them off even today.</p>

<p>But because the memories and association with my old blog quickly became negative, I eventually ditched it and created a new username in December of 2014: aroceu. I bought this domain at the time, but I also bought another one that I wanted to act as my primary domain. I dabbled in fanlistings and collectives for a short while, before I realized that much like anything else I'm interested in, I can't commit to something if I'm not hyperfixated on it.</p>

<p>I hit a dry spell after a few years for a bit in not knowing what to do with my love for making websites. I decided to prioritize efficiency by downsizing and making this domain my new main one. It largely resulted from my more concrete knowledge of my ability to maintain interest; though I don't believe I was much different from others, my expectations for myself were too high. In this transitional period, I was unsure what to do about the future because I had no idea what to do with my love for making websites anymore.</p>

<p>But that didn't stop the new ideas from coming and I got them anyway, starting with my prompt generators and my Pok&eacute;mon website &mdash; two massive projects that made me realize that I could do whatever I wanted as long as I thought it was awesome. And now that I was an adult with a job, I could download Photoshop <!-- (and still definitely do pay for it regularly mhm) --> so the quality of my graphics became as good as I had always wanted it to be when I was younger &mdash; to my own ability. I also purchased other domains, for whatever purpose I felt necessary, or just for fun. My hyperfixation on the hobby fluctuates from time to time, but I think there's a reason I keep coming back to it. Especially now that my presence on the independent web feels like a gallery of myself in a way that I feel proud of.</p>

<p>And here I am now. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading!</p>
