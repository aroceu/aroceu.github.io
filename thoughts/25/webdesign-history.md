# My webdesign origin story; or, humanity, the internet, me, and you

**February 12, 2025**

*The internet is a living museum.* - me

*Learning how to build a website is like starting any other form of art.* - also me

In recent months, I've talked a lot about my interest in the independent web and love for building websites. I've even written three pieces of documentation, one of which is a ridiculous length at over 10,000 words long.

I've mentioned several times how long I've been online - and, similarly, how long I've been interested in building websites. I've always been conscious of my passion for writing, but my interest in web development felt more technical. Cool. Sophisticated.

I suppose from a capitalistic angle, it is. Majoring in Creative Writing is like majoring in Art - what am I going to do with it, if I'm not immediately incredibly successful? Meanwhile, people are building websites all the time - startups, small businesses, industries. Websites need a webmaster to live, a human being behind it. Web development is a more profitable interest.

But I'm getting ahead of myself here. Though I've written a <a href="https://aroceu.com/manifesto">philosophical manifesto</a> and <a href="https://icirr.us/docs">10,000 words of why I wanted to make a Pok&eacute;mon website</a>, and referenced <a href="https://aroceu.github.io/thoughts/24/internet-archiving">many</a> <a href="https://aroceu.github.io/thoughts/24/social-media">more</a> <a href="https://aroceu.com/docs">times</a> elsewhere about my history on the internet, I want to get more detailed. I want to share my origin story. At least, from this interested-in-websites angle. 

So, let's get into it.

-

It was 2004 and I didn't know anything about the inner workings of the internet, only that I thought it was cool. I created a Neopets account because all of my summer camp friends were doing it, my username being a string of numbers that meant something to me. I had to ask my mom for permission to use her email to make my account, because I wasn't allowed to have an email yet. When I was on the internet, I was mostly playing flash games.

Then it was 2006, and my best friend was telling me I should get an email. Then she told me about Geocities, an extension of Yahoo that allowed users to create their own websites and put whatever they wanted on it. I didn't know the internet worked like that - that people could just share and post whatever they wanted to it. It was always more of a game console to me.

The first time I tried Geocities, my mind was blown. Having a website that I could put whatever I wanted on it and make it look <i>how</i>ever I wanted was something I had never fathomed before, because the internet felt like this sort of distant space for adult nerds, for people who had better attention spans than me. Yet the first or second day I started working on my Geocities "site" - a newsletter of just my thoughts - I sunk entire hours, afternoons, days into it. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I kept going back to look at it and think, <i>wow, I made that.</i>

I don't consider myself a shallow or superficial person, but by <i>god</i> do I love customizations. My favorite part of any RPG was a dollmaker, and whenever I would imagination-LARP with my friends or sibling, I loved just talking about what our characters were wearing. Though I don't think my website at the time was exceptionally - or actually - visually appealing, there was something special about knowing that this website that I not only built but customized with a WYSIWYG editor and my own two hands was alive. Out there, in public, on the internet.

My best friend was a critical component to my introduction and understanding of the web. After email and Geocities, she also told me I should get an IMVU and a MySpace account. IMVU was - or is, I suppose, as it's still up - a network of chatrooms through customized virtual dolls. There were ads for it everywhere; if you're around my age, you've probably seen them. 

Still, I was addicted to that shit. This was especially helped by the fact that IMVU profiles were editable, in a combined HTML and drag-and-drop way. Not only could I make my avatar look the way I wanted at my leisure (fun), but I could also make my profile look the way I wanted at my leisure too (even MORE fun!!!) I stole graphics; I stole ideas from my friends; I carved out my own aesthetic and changed the look of my profile every month or so. I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but it was fun and more importantly, it was all my choice.

When we started on MySpace, it wasn't as simple. I saw my best friend make her profile look similar to her IMVU page, but since I didn't know anything about HTML, I thought, how the hell did she do that? Lost without my WYSIWYG editors, I struggled at first. My pride eventually caved and I asked for her some help, and she explained to me some basics. Fonts could be changed with &lt;font&gt;, you can make text <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> with just a few brackets, and here's a code for changing your background color and you can just put the name of the color here. 

It was cool and simple enough. I wasn't that interested in learning what the more elaborate stuff with the background meant, anyway; I just wanted to know how to make my MySpace profile have a black background with white text. As my friend continued to make her profile more interesting and decorative, I had some envy but told myself that I didn't want to do what she was doing, anyway. She was a lot girlier than me. I was the weird one between the two of us, and I liked that my MySpace reflected that.

I usually cite Quizilla as my first fandom website, though "fandom" and "website" are pretty loose terms for it. I already knew the existence of Quizilla because I liked taking personality quizzes. But one day, another friend sent me a link to a chain email story that had been reposted to Quizilla, because this is so crazy, she said, isn't it weird and creepy? Yeah, I replied back to her in AIM, and clicked to see who had posted it. It was someone with a Nick Jonas-loving username, and I vaguely knew who Nick Jonas was because their cover of "What I Go To School For" by Busted had recently started playing on Disney Channel. This user didn't just love Nick Jonas, though - she wrote fanfiction about him.

But that's a different story, and goes more into my fanfiction history. This Nick Jonas person (and my subsequent obsession) isn't that relevant here, but it was a pivotal point that changed everything.

I quickly became interested in reading and writing and posting fanfiction on Quizilla, because that's what I did if I saw someone do something that made me think, <i>well, I could do that too</i>. It wasn't long before I stumbled across a Quizilla user profile that didn't just look like the basic site template - in fact, it looked nothing like it. It looked like the user had erased it and made the entire webpage themself from scratch, without even a Quizilla-inspired pixelstroke on it. I was fascinated, intrigued.

The footer of the profile had credits to the layout maker. I clicked it, and then saw that whoever had constructed the style of that webpage had made more, dozens for other people to use. But I didn't want to use any of them. Like my MySpace and IMVU profiles, I wanted to make my own thing. I didn't want to use something designed by someone else.

So I stole the code.

But I still barely knew a damn thing. Like playing a video game for the first time without reading anything, I didn't know what I was doing. This was before you could inspect elements with a right click, and before I was good at being resourceful on the internet. I stumbled and fell and stole a lot. I was taking other people's codes and trying to comprehend them by making my own preferred styles out of them, a lot like when people who are interested in drawing start off by tracing. I knew there were long webpages and tutorials or just people who could hold my hand if I asked. But I didn't want any of that. My vision was on the end goal of having a pretty Quizilla profile, not learning how to code. And reading too long on a screen for something that ultimately felt dull to learn by reading was never going to happen.

Despite my shortcomings, as I browsed Quizilla I eventually discovered Freewebs, or Webs, as it was known in its later years. This was through the layout credits of another Quizilla profile, to a Freewebs site that focused on making Quizilla HTML/CSS layouts, with some graphics. Like usual, I thought, <i>I want to do that too</i>. I didn't really think I <i>could</i> do it - but I wanted to, so I did. With my stolen code and all, I tried my hand at making my first website. 

I won't go into each website I had, each journey I went on with each new iteration of my internet presence. There quickly formed a hierarchy of prestige in my head when it came to owning a website: first Quizilla, then Freewebs, then a subdomain, and <i>then</i> a domain. And from 2008 to 2009, that was my entire journey. My best friend had a Freewebs as well but lost interest; I didn't, and continued with a creative drive and passion that, at the time, had only been reserved for my poetry and novel-writing. I liked making my own layouts and shitty little graphics in Paint. I liked aesthetically designing layouts that were supposed to be for others, with my stolen code and extremely rough understanding of CSS. I liked making new things, different things, adding my personal flair. Because ultimately, everything was still about what <i>I</i> wanted to make. 

Learning how to code came about slowly, and despite my own stubbornness. I was scraping away new knowledge with every new layout I made (always copied from a previous code). It was a good thing that I was addicted to making multiple layouts in one sitting, tracing several people's drawings a day. Eventually, after the aforementioned best friend and I had a complicated friendship breakup that only teen girls can have, I decided that I was growing out of my Freewebs site and wanted my first subdomain. But I didn't want a subdomain on a domain that I'd seen a bunch of other sites have. I wanted one with a smaller independent owner of a personal site, and one most people hadn't heard of before.

I found one, applied, and then I had it. My first subdomain. It felt so special and prestigious to me; because of that, I decided that I would finally write my own damn code from scratch. I knew enough, at this point, and I didn't mind learning a bit more to fill in the rest of the blanks. I was no longer confused by stylesheet ordering or brackets; I knew how hex colors and links and images worked. Even more than that, I had a better understanding of what made a website look good. Not yellow Times New Roman text on a black background like on my first Geocities site; not graphic-dependent layouts with text all over the place, like a lot of the first layouts I made. Nah, I could write this website from scratch *and* make it look good, finally, at the same time.

I did, and I was happy with it. I had recently started getting addicted to the dopamine of publishing short stories and receiving feedback, though, so all of my creative energy was going to that. But it was nice typing in a URL and going to my website and just looking at it, my virtual space, and knew that it was made for me, because it was made <i>by</i> me. 

Back when I had my Freewebs site - I'm mentioning this now for storytelling purposes - I wasn't just obsessed with making layouts. I was also obsessed with looking for affiliates. In other words, I loved discovering other people's websites, and just looking at them. Though most of the time they were similar in offering graphics and layout codes (and, eventually, blogs), the most interesting part to me was that they were all distinct, personal. In content, of course, but also in design, layout, structure, navigation. One of the reasons I've always been self-conscious about my abilities as a graphic artist is because early in my interest in this hobby, so many of the sites I admired and asked to affiliate with had incredible graphics and edits that I couldn't even come up with if I tried. The idea of piecing together multiple different pictures and textures and colors and pixels and layers for a single large website graphic was puzzling and intimidating to me. I liked making small graphics for fun, or a relatively simple one that didn't make you look too closely at it. I did try my hand at it, because I had thought, <i>I could do that</i>, again. But I couldn't. And honestly, I didn't really want to.

Still, it didn't stop me from admiring other people's sites, visiting them over and over again and combing through their list of affiliates and clicking on the buttons that I thought looked pretty and promising. I loved seeing new ways people could construct a website; new ways people could show off their own creativity in their own space, with their own interests. I'd spend hours digging through one website's affiliates, and then <i>those</i> websites' affiliates, and then <i>those</i> websites' affiliates, and so on. Even if there were some that I didn't ask to affiliate with and only lurked on, I loved clicking through, and sometimes finding a website that completely rocked my world when I least expected it. And I still do.

In 2008, the aforementioned (not-yet-ex-)best friend told me I should get a Facebook, too. I went on the website and made an account and tried to find the edit profile page so I could make it look pretty.

Yeah, there wasn't any page like that.

Damn, I thought, this was it? What was the point, if I couldn't make my profile look unique? Aside from a profile picture, it literally looked like everyone else's. Where was the customization, the prettiness? At least let me make the link colors on my page look different.

I had a LiveJournal, later, but that was a completely different beast of customization, and way too many options to think about, so I was comfortable with not making the design my own, for once. I was more distracted by my obsession with k-pop at the time, and I wasn't using any of the default LiveJournal skins, but by layout makers like milou-veronica and minty-peach. There was still an element of individuality, even if it wasn't the uniqueness I preferred. (In 2012 I made my own LiveJournal layout, but I digress.)

At least Twitter had customization options, and was a space where I could say way too much about things that meant very little. The dopamine of instant short-form notifications helped too. Though I couldn't do much beyond making link colors look different on my profile (for everyone, not just me) and add a background image, it was something.

I liked to change my LiveJournal layout every so often; my Twitter color and background; all of my website layouts, when I was interested in making them instead of writing k-pop fanfiction. My first subdomain, which I had for five months, went under five design changes. My first domain only had two (see: the k-pop fanfiction), but after that when I dove headfirst back into website-making again, my subdomain from late 2011 to mid 2013 went through <i>thirteen</i> layout changes. That was a new one basically once a month, too, since in early 2013 I got hit with such a heavy wave of depression that I didn't make a new layout until I acquired a new domain that summer.

Even so, my affinity to design - to change designs - continued, as my websites changed, as <i>I</i> changed. Having one aesthetic and then pivoting to a completely different one felt a little bit like starting over, or at least a new two-page spread in a book. It allowed me to experiment with different ways to customize, and different structures that I liked. Though I hadn't found myself yet, I was still searching for her. Each new design felt like discovering something new inside of me, too.

Coding is hard. Socializing is hard. Having the resources to understand what you're doing at any given time is pretty fucking hard.

You know what's not hard?

- Enjoying things
- Wanting things
- Being yourself, as long as you allow yourself to

I always thought of fiction writing to be my more creative interest, and web development and design to be my more technical interest. But the truth is that they're not that different. I also think of myself as quite introverted and avoidant - but at my core, especially after writing all this, I know I have a fascination with people. I love reading all sorts of stories and looking through all sorts of websites because I enjoy discovering new perspectives, new ways people interact with the world.

This isn't just about me, though, and I like to think most people are curious like this, too. Humans have been creating art since the beginning of time. And we've been interested in experiencing each other's art, because we're interested in experiencing each other. The more different and unique we all are, the newer ways we teach each other to think. Whether in music, or drawing, or inventive ways of communication - we do, because communication is art, and art is communication.

Websites are not corporate and mechanical. At least, that has never been their only function. Websites are humans, bodies, worlds. They're forms of self-expression, even if they're just pixels on a screen. It might sound daunting in today's world where we talk about social media and apps and videos. But the truth is that anyone can open up a file on their computer. write <code>Hello!</code> on it, save it as <code>index.html</code>, open it up in their web browser, and make a website.

To own a website is to be creative, be yourself, especially in a world that wants you to conform and fear technology. To own a website is an act of resistance, a demand for the world to witness you. Yeah, it's just a website - but in a social atmosphere that talks so much about <i>social media</i> and <i>being on our phones</i> and <i>likes and comments and reposts</i>, a personal website gives you the space to breathe. There's no one else here to impress. Only you.

I'm interested in telling my story because, undeniably, I would not be as passionate or deep into this hobby without the influence of other people. My friends were always showing me new things, and I craned my neck and asked for more. Then I continued because being interested in new designs wasn't just about the websites, but also discovering new *people*. People are what make the internet - hell, we built the internet. Rotten Tomatoes was made by a guy because he wanted to talk about the Rush Hour movies; YouTube and LiveJournal were started by college guys who wanted to make something useful to their peers; and don't even get me started on Facebook. Though corporate internet can feel hierarchal, oftentimes it really is just easy as creating a Neocities account (or Nekoweb, if you prefer), editing your <code>index.html</code> page, and suddenly having your own website.

The corporate powerhouses of the internet want us to only use the same three sites to put more money into already-rich people's pockets and forget about the vastness of the web. But we don't have to. They know this, of course; I feel like I've been hearing people talk about <i>algorithms</i> more ever since Tiktok took off. Still, with every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; with every cultural trend there's always a counter-culture ready to push back.

Though my websites are not the most exceptional thing to exist, I love having them, designing them, and working on them, because they're evidence of my own agency in many ways, particularly creatively and technically. I'm not limited to the same blue-and-white rectangles of Facebook profiles; I'm not even limited to LiveJournal or Tumblr or MySpace HTML structures. My websites are a celebration of my choices and aesthetic tastes. And as over time I became more sure and confident in myself, my ability to keep a webpage layout for months - years, even - has actually grown and sustained, because I like who I am a lot more now.

Having a website, much like any other form of art, is an introspective journey. It made me ask myself things we all ask ourselves at some point in our lives: Who am I? How do I want to be seen? What's important to me? Is this the real me? Does this make me feel fulfilled?

It was through the creative space of website-making where I explored this at many different stages of my life. I like looking at my archive of old designs because I can see the evidence of who I used to be, and how I became someone I like being a lot more, eventually, over time. I wouldn't have been able to do that without channeling my creativity, my humanity into my websites. And I wouldn't have been able to do that without other people.

I was lucky to be enamored with website-making at a young age. But I remember how lost and ignorant and impatient I felt, in the beginning. Websites can feel intimidating and scary, because there are some that do things in ways that most of us will never understand. There's all sorts of brackets and jargon and terminology. In fact, recently when a friend asked me what a "static site" meant, I had to look it up to double check that my understanding of it was correct.

I'm writing this to encourage people to make their own website, no matter how unfamiliar they may be with it or how little interest they may have in all the technical aspects. No pressure, of course. I just have a lot of feelings about it. But more than that I want to emphasize the creative and artistic humanity behind it. I like having accounts, but at some point it starts feeling like I'm putting myself into these little corporate boxes. Follow me on Twitter. Follow my Instagram. Add me on Facebook. Social media accounts aren't all who I am, or who any of us are. They help us communicate in a lot more convenient ways - but another part of that reality is advertising revenue for incredibly wealthy corporations.

Regardless, all I know is my truth: that I love websites because I love the internet, because I'm curious about people, especially in a creative and self-celebratory way. I want to see people be unapologetic as much as I want to be unapologetic - weird, interesting, different, <i>human</i>. We each have our own likes, dislikes, comforts, preferences; we have our own languages, thoughts, feelings, ways of communication. We have our own tendencies and habits, personalities, obsessions. 

And the more agency we have on a website, the more we can express these parts of ourselves, authentically, and shamelessly, just like any other creative form. Though I don't expect everyone in the world to want to make a personal website, I'd still like to challenge anyone who's made it this far into this post. If I can go from being a preteen who was worried that putting text in brackets would show up as-is on my MySpace profile and then getting mystified when it turned the text red, to owning three elaborately designed domains now, then I think anyone can make a website. These days, I own some of the coolest websites I've ever been on, and a lot of why I think that is because they're <i>mine</i>. But I don't think this is a unique talent. I don't <i>want</i> it to be a unique talent. I think anyone can do this.

So forget what you know about social media sites for a second and take a look at the screen around you.

Now think to yourself: <i>I could do that too</i>.
