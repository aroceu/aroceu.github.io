# ricetard.nu (2013-2014)

Once upon a time this was my ideal domain; unfortunately by the time I could procure it, I was going through a difficult time in my life, particularly with regards to my mental health. Since I was trying to blog at the same time, I soon could only associate my website with my depression, which is why after only a year I decided to change websites, and my username entirely. It's not a great one, anyway.

The designs I made during this period, however, are among some of my favorites still even today.

**Total count:** 14
