**Since you have so many websites, what's the point of having a Github pages?**

I use my Github pages as kind of as an aside to my existence online - random note taking in the wiki, my galleries and archives, and other online miscellany that has nothing to do with my websites or my online identity. It's basically an online and public way for keep to take note and keep track of things while also not being as front and center as the rest of my websites.

A lot of how I operate online is based on an inexplicable psychic feeling of comfort. I'm very conscious of how I feel not only in what I share, but also where and how I share it, and what the presentation is like. My websites are kind of a voyeur-friendly presentation of myself. In contrast, things on my Github are largely for myself. Since design is a significant part of my virtual experience - both in process, and in my relationship with what/where/how I'm sharing something - having my Github pages laid out in the default layout takes away the more intricately and personally designed part of its existence as a website, and puts more focus on its content. Since my Github pages are for me, I like it like this. If it was on any of my personal websites or had a custom design, it would feel like there's still some sort of voyeuristic presentation-element in its entire existence. But because there's not, it gives me far more comfort to feel like it's a little commonplace book, mostly for me.

**Why don't you make F2U/free to use layouts/themes anymore?**

One thing I've said consistently - and remains to be true - is that I got into webdesign for myself. I started out "making" F2U layouts because it was the best way for me to learn. I found tutorials dull and guides boring; I was more eager to have the finished product in front of my hands rather than valuing the process along the way. I don't agree with the principles I had at the time, but in all fairness, I was young, a beginner, and not very good at *anything* back then.

So I made a lot of these because I got a rush when they were done. I don't think most of them are very good (you can see the gallery for yourself), and I think it was bold that I made them "available" for others in the first place, haha. But my point is that even though I made them then, that wasn't the real intention behind me making them. The real intention was for me to learn. For better or worse, with more or less principles than you'd approve of. Either way, I learned.

And I got better. It didn't take me long to realize that once I had a template/idea in mind, all it really took from me was to implement it - or, to learn how to implement it. Free to use codes are templates, after all. At least in my eyes; those with less or a different sort of creative passion when it comes to expressing yourself online might not care about the uniqueness of website design. But part of why I "made"/started with making F2U layouts in the first place was because I was learning code through modifying other people's, even if the end result looked totally different. Once I figured out how to write the code myself I didn't need to do that, so my next endeavor (after a year of stealing code) was to use my knowledge and translate a template I had in mind through my own code. 

Through this, I found that while many websites *can* look different (and should, and do), there's still a formula to it all. At least, for me and how I think about websites and building them. I learned what kind of templates I preferred, what kind of sites I preferred, and subconsciously really dug into the design of function and function of design. It's why I think about website-making as architecture now; why now every time I approach a new website project, I think to myself, *okay, so header, navigation, footer, do I want a sidebar?* instead of imagining things all over the place.

I'm a lot better at making websites now because I understand the templates that I like, as well as how to do a whole lot more in code, even if I might not implement everything on my own sites. That's why I made F2U layouts in the first place, to discover new techniques as well as the things I liked. Once I did, my interest in making them fell away, because I'd rather people learn and figure things out for themselves in the same way that I did. 

Additionally, my old F2U layouts were mostly made for Quizilla/Mibba because the internet was different back then and had a better use case for simple themed layouts that didn't necessarily need to be personalized. But neither of those sites are live anymore, and from what I understand the trend to be these days, I'm not very interested in making templates for people to customize themselves, just as a personal thing. I support anyone who chooses to do so, of course, but at this moment in time it's not for me.

TL;DR My reason for making F2U layouts in the first place was more for me to learn than to truly make and share "free to use" content (based on my own motivations/passions). Once I learned enough I became more interested in applying my skills to my own sites rather than making things for other people, so that interest hasn't returned since. 

HOWEVER, as exceptions always exist, I will always be happy to make base code templates for friends and specific requests. This is a one-on-one thing, though; I'm not interested in writing code for others in hopes that someone will use it, but rather I'm happy to write code if I *know* that it's because someone plans on using it.

**What's your real opinion on all this 'copying is love'/'copying is theft' business?**

I've quoted [Copyheart](https://copyheart.org/manifesto/) before because it is more similar to my belief and general way of operating in life to [do what the fuck you want](https://www.wtfpl.net/). What it means to me may not mean the same thing to someone else, and that's fine.

As you may expect, my stance is informed by my experiences, the same way that I understand other people's stances are informed by their experiences. If you've seen - or been exposed to, or generally fear - creative ideas, works, time and effort being stolen without respect to the creator, it would make sense for you to be anti-copying. If you haven't, or if you're more passionate and interested in other people sharing, learning, and figuring things out themselves, even if it's at risk of your own ideas getting disrespected, you'd be more inclined to be pro-copying.

I say this like it's this simple, but of course it's not. Nothing is. People aren't, problems aren't, solutions aren't, and the things we feel and experience aren't. I'm not going to (try to) persuade someone who's been hurt by copying before to just accept that sometimes people will copy you. In the same way, someone who is fearful of being copied at all times isn't going to convince me that, just because those people are out there, should mean I ought to feel the same way.

I say all this because what I believe is informed how I feel, and it is not my business to tell people how to feel, and in the same way, tell them what to believe. I do my best to understand and be sympathetic; I do not believe, by default, that if someone disagrees with me, it's out of malice or inferiority. It's out of different lived experiences and feelings, different expectations, people, and circumstances. The conclusions I draw are from my own experiences, but I have not experienced everything in the world. Neither has anyone. That's why we value nuance.

But what I will say is this: you can drain all the water you want, but if a horse wants to drink, it's going to find a way to drink. And if the horse doesn't want to drink, then it won't. We can't control people and we can't dictate what they do. We can talk all we want, but in the end what *you* say and *you* do is still your choice. And that is a reflection of you, not me. If I put "this is all my code, do not steal," on my code, it won't stop anyone who really wants to copy it from copying it. It is perfunctory, a message. It is a reflection of my possessiveness and my fear; it does not control anyone who actually reads it.

I could say something quippy here like *I'm not a cop (or your mom)* or *the freedom to be also means the freedom to be flawed*, even though these are sentiments that my principles align with. Ultimately, though, it's really to say that we're all human, we'll all do whatever we want even if other people tell us to stop, and we do and say the things we do for reasons that are only and best known by us. And as a creative, I know that 'copying' is not as clear-cut and dry as some may make it out to be - it can be synonymous with plagiarism, yes, but it can also be colloquial, less literal, a different iteration of "imitation is the highest form of flattery," inspirational. Hell, someone can just like something and want to do their own spin on it, and others can see it as copying. What it means to "copy" depends, as always, on a contextual basis.

I like generalizing for fun, but I don't like speaking with absolute certainty, because in the same way there's nuance and grey areas, there's also always other people's perspectives, and how they interpret what "copying" means. No perspective is superior to the other; objecitivity is a collective, seeming majority truth, but still not necessarily inclusive of every perspective out there, because we have no way of knowing every perspective in existence. You'll interpret my words based on what these words mean to you and what you think of me, things that I have no way of knowing. I write these words because I know what I'm about, what I'm trying to say, and am trying to communicate it in the most accessible (albeit slightly overwrought) way possible.

In essence: it's complicated, because it always is, but I like to err on the side of creative exploration, and the free will of others over my own individualism, because I am not that different from you. I am not so restrictive or precious that I want to shut people out, and I will always rather make the mistake of being too kind than being too cruel. Of course, I have a sense of self-preservation and my own uniqueness that I (admittedly) think it would be *very* difficult to copy me without actually being me. 

When it comes to webdesign, I don't care about copying (if I'm not being Single White Female'd) because that kind of individualistic value of intellectual property over aesthetics or code is something I simply don't care about. I would rather someone make a new site I can look at even if it looks the same as someone else's, because at least they're learning something. (They even may regret it in the future.) I would rather have a negative opinion about a same-y looking site than that site - and that person's interest in making the site - not exist at all. I would rather close a tab button and feel my negative feelings instead of telling people how they *should* design, what their tastes *should* be, what kind of things they *should* like, what they *should* say or do. I want to do what the fuck I want. In the same way, I want other people to do what the fuck they want.

Though it's another story when money's involved. But mostly because I don't even like the involvement of money in the world of creativity in the first place.
