# website notes

A small set of "rules" for what goes on my websites. In general, if I have a list of links somewhere, there's no such thing as the list becoming too bloated.

## aroceu.com

### fic

Anything that I would post for availability to the general public, with a handful of exceptions for:

- Older fic
- Some anon fic; other anon fic is also posted here
- Most WIPs and older ficlets even for events, though those are publicly available on my [writing dreamwidth](https://aroceu.dreamwidth.org)

All creative works related to any of my fic but not made by me is also archived here, even if I have deleted the fic myself. Fic fanart and remixes are here as well, and do not overlap with gifts unless I received the work a) as a gift for an exchange of some sort; or b) as a personal gift of some sort (such as for my birthday).

### library

The main library archive lists things I like that are or were relevant to my identity or a significant period of my life at one point, but not necessarily exhaustively everything. Ergo, I don't have to edit it with each new form of entertainment I consume unless I consider it relevant enough to share.

In the same vein, the to-do list contains media that I intend to, with all my heart, be exposed to at some point in time; my flakey attention span just makes it difficult. But these are things that I actively want to experience, not just things I haven't yet nor are they determinate of what I may be entertained by in the future.

The log is a list of things I've <i>enjoyed</i> throughout a year &mdash; again, much like the library, not just everything I have possibly consumed. I have Letterboxd and Last.fm (and eventually Storygraph) for that; these are just the notable things that I liked.

The music on the log consists of only:

- albums
- mashups / covers / things more likely to be found on Youtube than a streaming service

I am not good at following the queue on my log but whatever it's the thought that counts.

### music

Songs on a yearly playlist are new only compared to the other yearly playlists, but not necessarily compared to my life. When a song appears on a yearly playlist, that should be its only presence across <i>all</i> playlists.

The only exception to this is when the song is part of a bigger hyperfixation, e.g. Panic! at the Disco and BLACKPINK.

Mashups are not listed here, but can be found on my library log.

Albums are listed in addition to the song artist if the song itself was never a single or if I listened to the rest of the album.

Features are also mentioned alongside the song artist.

I don't bother indicating different versions of an album unless it's a re-release (i.e. Taylor's versions.)

For some playlists, there are songs that I got into December of the previous year but would attribute more as a following year song, while for other yearly playlists I would add December songs to its respective yearly playlist. This is mostly based on vibes and what I want to put where. Plus, I can always make modifications in the future. Tl;dr I don't have real rules for this, just what I feel is most suitable in the moment (and may modify if I change my mind later.)

### gifts

The only real rule here is that fic art only appears here if it organically fits into either one of the main art categories, as a commission or as a personal gift (from a friend or for an exchange.) This is to avoid excessive cross-posting from my fic site.

### projects

Anything I would consider "fannish" in any regard (either as commentary on fandom, or I made it out of being a fan of something) but is not a fanfic.

### manifesto

Links aggregated at the end of this page are related to philosophical, existential, and humanist reflections on one's internet presence and experiences, and oftentimes (though not always) how creating a personal website can free one from the corporate social media shackles of the modern internet.

### personal sites (buttons)

Websites that I admire and respect and would like to return to for some inspiration. I find both the content they share on their website as well as the site's structural design to be both inspirational and unique. The content itself is also somewhat relevant to me in some way.

My actual standards for these sites:
- must have an 88x31 button (no exceptions)
- must have an exits out page (some exceptions)
- website quality and design must be to the point that makes me think, *Wow, I wish I could (want to) do that* (particularly more than me thinking *okay but I could do that better*). The only exception to this is if the content makes me think that instead.
- left-leaning/socialist/LGBT (no exceptions)
- site must be mostly "complete" with minimal to no dead links. Not so much a finished product as much as having enough to feel like you can spend more than 5 minutes visiting it and not clicking on a broken or unused link. (no exceptions)
- site must be relatively active, as in updated within a reasonable few months upon my scouring sites to add to the list. I do not regularly check for activity (though I'll probably do some cleaning in a year's time). I want sites that are in-progress but with promise *and* with plenty for the visitor to see regardless. (few exceptions)
- there must be something unique about the site to me, but that's based purely on vibes and how I experience uniqueness. (no exceptions)
- the site must be accessible by my preferred standards (no audio or autoplayed music, visually appealing spacing, sized nicely and appropriately, not that difficult to navigate) while being able to retain its uniqueness (some exceptions)
- site must be in English (so I can read it)
- sites must be pseudonymous in nature (no real life names and minimal selfies, and as my own identity is pseudonymous, to retain that boundary. basically no professional sites and things branded with wallet names)
- webmasters must be adults
- heavy preference for designs being handcoded by the webmaster
- design feels like a solid established identity confident and liked by and for the webmaster. website is constructed with a personal passion for the internet or just drive to self-express
- a little extra levity granted to non-neocities/nekoweb sites and independent domains (in terms of content or design appeal)

There are no preferences for design style or aesthetic, only that they are done well. There is also no technical standard for content, but I link sites that I want to visit again so they have to appeal to me in some way in content anyway.

### personal sites (bottom)

Friends!!

### links

Links that <i>I</i> want to save for one reason or another, not just to share. Potential personal use case is the top priority for links shared here (with the current only exception being the art website resource list, because I have a lot of artist friends.)
