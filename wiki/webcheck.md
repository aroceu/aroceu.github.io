# website checklist

This isn't a real checklist for myself or for other people to use as a reference. Rather, it's just an internal evaluation of preferences that I like to see in personal websites. Make websites however you want! But if for some reason you'd like them to appeal to me, here are some things you can keep in mind.

...and for full disclosure I suppose these are things that I would consider a "good" personal website to have. But that's only because I've been here for years and have spent a lot of time thinking about it. 

1. An about page

    This is #1 because this is the most critical. I like reading about webmasters! I think everyone does. I think it says a lot about how you talk about yourself, and what you say. Not in a judgmental way - but in a vulnerable way. It gives an interesting perspective as a visitor when you read about the creator while viewing and interacting with the result, it feels very... idk, voyeuristic is usually the word that comes to mind, haha. But I think us talking about ourselves is important because it reveals how we think about ourselves and how much we know about ourselves, and it's also interesting to witness it as an audience. And it gives people an idea of who you are (I will write a <a href="https://arrow.bearblog.dev">blog post</a> on the concept of body language/physical presence over the internet soon, but this is part of it) and what they can expect from you in the future.
    Also, it can give a vague sense of your politics and beliefs in human rights, even if you don't state it outright.

2. Last updated/something indicating when the last activity on the website is

    This is mostly to get a sense of how active the webmaster/website is, so I know how frequently I might have to check it again in the future. Archives are better imo, but just a last updated date isn't bad either. But I will say that I do have more interest in websites that feel more alive than ones that feel abandoned (but I don't think it's impossible to revive them either - it's just fun to see things change!)

3. Links out

    Ever since my very first website I've been a huge enthusiast for the affiliation process. Mostly because it was an excuse to see a bunch of different people's sites and the cool ways they could make them different. That was my favorite part. I liked seeing everyone's and uniqueness. 

    Anyway, I put this here as a bulletpoint just because in my experience it's always been a part of the process of having an indie site. And why shouldn't it be? No one has to make friends, but I think every personal website is worth seeing. And even if it's not actual mutuals and affiliates, honestly that makes links out pages even better to me - someone listing a bunch of website buttons for the love of the game, for the websites. (Admittedly, that's also what I do <a href="https://kingdra.net/pages/sites.php">here</a> &gt;_&gt; lol.) 
    
    Either way, I do generally prefer and think better of websites who have a links out page, no matter how big or small. I just think the whole point of the internet is for us to link to each other, you know?

4. About the site

    I always like seeing what the webmaster thinks about the site, why they made it, how it came to be in the first place, the story behind the name. Everything! It's interesting to me, at least, to see a cool website and also have a page dedicated to its lore, too. Old websites, archives, how the current one came about, past designs, the significance and meaning and intention behind the current design. I love knowing that things are done and made with intention, and I like knowing the story behind them too. It just makes the human connection more real, and the soul of the website a little livelier.

5. Buttons/banners for the site.

    Corporate advertisements are lame, but individual advertisements are awesome. I've always believed in the power of a linkback button - a small concise way to give strangers the vibe of your site. They might not know what it's about or what *you're* about, but that's the beauty and power of a linkback button. Is it the branding? The aesthetic design? The use of colors? Fonts? Something that makes the button a little less conventional within its constraints? Sometimes when I don't have the patience to click through *every* button on a button wall, I only click the ones that look appealing to me. It's about encapsulating your website's vibe - *your* vibe - through 88x31 pixels. More often than not, linkback buttons are people's first impression of your site. So often these buttons answer the question of, what do you want your first impression on others to be?

6. Different colored links

    This is such a specific personal preference of mine but yeah I find websites 1000% more interesting when their links don't look like the default browser style. A lot of times unstyled links can make or break a website's appeal to me tbh. I want to know how people style the type of text that appears the most often because it helps direct you on your navigational journey through pages and sources and people...
