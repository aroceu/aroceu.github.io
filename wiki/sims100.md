# sims 100 babies challenge

* Create a Sim to start out with. We’ll call her the matriarch. She may have any traits, aspiration, appearance, walk style, and voice you like. 
* Move your matriarch into any lot she can afford with her starting funds. You may move as many times as you want during the challenge as long as you can afford it without cheating. 	
* You must play with aging on and set to a normal lifespan. Auto-Aging for NPCs is encouraged to ensure the game keeps generating donors for your matriarch. 
* No cheats! The only exceptions to this are bb.moveobjects on for creative building purposes and cheating to resolve glitches. 
* If a lot your matriarch moves into has existing lot traits, you may not edit or add to them. If your lot has no lot traits, you may pick three traits but your decision is permanent. You cannot change them after.
* 
* All in-game rewards from completing aspirations and social events may be used except ones that prolong your Sim’s lifespan or save them from death. 
* Babies cannot be aged up until you get a notification saying that it is their birthday. 
* Toddlers can be aged up when they reach level 3 in all toddler skills. 
* Children and teenagers can be aged up when they get an A in school. 
* Young adults can be moved out of the house to make room for more children but they cannot be moved back in after. 
* When your matriarch becomes an elder and can no longer bear children, her youngest daughter takes over as the next matriarch. You may move out your elderly matriarch only if her youngest daughter has become a young adult. 
* You cannot make more room in the house faster by killing off underage Sims or letting babies, toddlers or children be taken by social services. Raise your children to adulthood. Sim ple. 
* Your matriarchs may register as self-employed but cannot have a career. They must make money at home through one of the skills. 
* Teenagers may hold part-time jobs to help support the family and bring in extra income. 
* Your matriarch may leave her home lot freely. She does not have to bring all her children with her whenever she leaves the lot. 
* Your matriarch may not get married while she is of child-bearing age. She may get married as an elder but she must move out of the home with her spouse. They can’t move into the active household. 
* Your matriarch may not get pregnant by the same donor twice. Once he has impregnated your Sim once, he cannot be used again for more children. 
* Donors may not contribute to the household in any way. They may not move in, help look after the children or provide any financial aid to the household. Your matriarch is responsible for supporting all her children by herself. 
* Your matriarch may not influence the gender of her children. Avoid strawberries, carrots, pop music, and alternative music to avoid influencing the gender of unborn babies. 
* Use Pinstar’s random trait generator or createarandomsim.com to randomly assign traits to your matriarch’s children. You cannot cherry pick their traits.
* 
* You may hire maids, gardeners, and repair technicians, but you may not hire a nanny. Take care of your own children. You may hire caterers and mixologists but only for parties.
