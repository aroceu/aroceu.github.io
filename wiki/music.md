### made for me, aka songs that are completely in tune with my tastes

[Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/58x9UPaE78gtAmWSFqJnCv?si=22f488e322334059)

The tl;dr of these songs are just ones that altered my brain chemistry significantly. Which has happened many times.

I like a lot of different types of songs (in the same way that I like a lot of different types of things, generally, as well as different types of people)... but much like anything else, I do have preferences. When it comes to music, there's a particular sonic palate that I tend to get drawn to - synthy hyperpop elements with a little bit of an old school/live instrument/alt-rocky touch, a major key with a minor touch, parts that are fun to belt and sing along to, and sometimes a little bit of toxicity and/or sexuality in the lyrics. Also a rap break and/or an acapella moment, preferably. And a mashup / cover moment.

With a beat, of course. I'm so percussive brained that I just also tend to like songs the livelier they are. But a slow song with a build also fits in here too, I'd say. (I do love ballads if the melody is really good, even though they're not necessarily in this flavor for me.)

As you might imagine, there is a lot of crossover here with songs already on this page. However, not all of these songs are my favorites by an artist, but are certainly up there.

Italics are songs that made me go "oh yeah this one is definitely made for me" on first listen. Sometimes you just know.
